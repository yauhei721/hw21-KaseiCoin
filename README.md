## Software Testing

1. To the the software, we test by deploying the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache. First we depoly the contracts in the Injected Web3 enviornment to join the Metamask, Ganache, and Remix together in this testing enviornment.

2. Then we depoly first the KaseiCoinDepolyer contract in the injected web3 environment by inputting the token name, symbol, and one of the imported address from Metamask.
